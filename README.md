# Project 14 (BucketList)

This is my solution to the BucketList project (project 14) in the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)). This was an introduction to integrating Map Kit into a SwiftUI project. Along the way it also introduced us to adding Codable support to a third party object and working with data stored in the app's Documents directory. There are a couple of things around writing protected data and its subsequent load that just don't seem to work as described.
